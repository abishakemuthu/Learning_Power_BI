Power BI is a data visualization and business intelligence tool developed by Microsoft. It allows users to connect to various data sources, transform and clean the data, and create interactive reports and dashboards. With Power BI, users can visualize data through charts, graphs, and maps, making it easier to analyze and share insights across an organization. It supports real-time data monitoring and can be accessed on different devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones. Power BI is commonly used for making data-driven decisions and presenting data in a user-friendly manner.

### Source

I have Learned Power BI from Pavan Lalwani. He has a Youtube Channel with good content for Power BI.

### Data

I have used Sample Superstore Dataset for Learning. It is a fictional collection of data about a retail superstore contains variables like Order ID, Order Date, Ship Date, Ship Mode, Customer ID, Customer Name, Segment, Country/Region, City, State, Postal Code, Region, Product ID, Category, Sub-Category, Product Name, Sales, Quantity, Discount, Profit.

### Sample Superstore Profit Report

I have prepared this report for Learning. While preparing this report I have Learned many things by creating,
- Charts and Maps
- Table and Matrix
- Cards and Filters
- Slicers
- Objects and Actions

### Charts

Charts in Power BI are used to visualize data, identify trends, compare categories, and highlight key insights. They make it easy to explore and interact with data, summarize information, and present findings clearly.

### Maps

Maps in Power BI are used to visualize geographical data, showing how metrics like sales or population vary across different regions. They help identify patterns, trends, and insights based on location.

### Tables and Matrices

Tables and matrices in Power BI are used to display detailed data in a grid format. Tables and matrices allow for grouping, summarizing and pivoting data to show aggregated values, making it easier to analyze and compare information.

### Cards and Filters

Cards in Power BI display key metrics or single values, such as total sales or profit for quick reference. Filters allow users to refine and narrow down the data shown in visuals, making it easier to focus on specific information or analyze subsets of data.

### Slicers

Slicers in Power BI are visual tools that allow users to filter data on a report or dashboard interactively. They make it easy to focus on specific categories or time periods by selecting values directly from the slicer, dynamically updating the visuals accordingly.

### Objects and Actions

Objects in Power BI, such as buttons and shapes, enhance reports by adding interactive elements. Actions allow users to create interactivity, like navigating to different pages, filtering data, or triggering other actions, making reports more dynamic and user-friendly.
